/**
 * This class implements boolean operations (intersection, union, difference, and symmetric
 * difference) for regions whose boundaries are defined by geodesic edges.
 *
 * <p>S2BooleanOperation operates on exactly two input regions at a time. Each region is represented
 * as an S2ShapeIndex and may contain any number of points, polylines, and polygons. The region is
 * essentially the union of these objects, except that polygon interiors must be disjoint from all
 * other geometry (including other polygon interiors). If the input geometry for a region does not
 * meet this condition, it can be normalized by computing its union first. Duplicate polygon edges
 * are not allowed (even among different polygons), however polylines may have duplicate edges and
 * may even be self-intersecting. Note that points or polylines are allowed to coincide with the
 * boundaries of polygons.
 *
 * <p>Degeneracies are fully supported. Supported degeneracy types include the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Point polylines consisting of a single degenerate edge AA.
 *   <li>Point loops consisting of a single vertex A. Such loops may represent either shells or
 *       holes according to whether the loop adds to or subtracts from the surrounding region of the
 *       polygon.
 *   <li>Sibling edge pairs of the form {AB, BA}. Such sibling pairs may represent either shells or
 *       holes according to whether they add to or subtract from the surrounding region. The edges
 *       of a sibling pair may belong to the same polygon loop (e.g. a loop AB) or to different
 *       polygon loops or polygons (e.g. the polygons {ABC, CBD}).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A big advantage of degeneracy support is that geometry may be simplified without completely
 * losing small details. For example, if a polygon representing a land area with many lakes and
 * rivers is simplified using a tolerance of 1 kilometer, every water feature in the input is
 * guaranteed to be within 1 kilometer of some water feature in the output (even if some lakes and
 * rivers are merged and/or reduced to degenerate point or sibling edge pair holes). Mathematically
 * speaking, degeneracy support allows geometry to be simplified while guaranteeing that the
 * Hausdorff distance between the boundaries of the original and simplified geometries is at most
 * the simplification tolerance. It also allows geometry to be simplified without changing its
 * dimension, thus preserving boundary semantics. (Note that the boundary of a polyline ABCD is
 * {A,D}, whereas the boundary of a degenerate shell ABCDCB is its entire set of vertices and
 * edges.)
 *
 * <p>Points and polyline edges are treated as multisets: if the same point or polyline edge appears
 * multiple times in the input, it will appear multiple times in the output. For example, the union
 * of a point with an identical point consists of two points. This feature is useful for modeling
 * large sets of points or polylines as a single region while maintaining their distinct identities,
 * even when the points or polylines intersect each other. It is also useful for reconstructing
 * polylines that loop back on themselves (e.g., time series such as GPS tracks). If duplicate
 * geometry is not desired, it can easily be removed by choosing the appropriate S2Builder output
 * layer options.
 *
 * <p>Self-intersecting polylines can be manipulated without materializing new vertices at the
 * self-intersection points. This feature is important when processing polylines with large numbers
 * of self-intersections such as GPS tracks (e.g., consider the path of a race car in the Indy 500).
 *
 * <p>Polylines are always considered to be directed. Polyline edges between the same pair of
 * vertices are defined to intersect even if the two edges are in opposite directions. (Undirected
 * polylines can be modeled by specifying GraphOptions.EdgeType.UNDIRECTED in the S2Builder output
 * layer.)
 *
 * <p>The output of each operation is sent to an S2BuilderLayer provided by the client. This allows
 * clients to build any representation of the geometry they choose. It also allows the client to do
 * additional postprocessing of the output before building data structures; for example, the client
 * can easily discard degeneracies or convert them to another data type.
 *
 * <p>The boundaries of polygons and polylines can be modeled as open, semi-open, or closed.
 * Polyline boundaries are controlled by the PolylineModel class, whose options are as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>In the OPEN model, polylines do not contain their first or last vertex except for one
 *       special case: namely, if the polyline forms a loop and the polylineLoopsHaveBoundaries()
 *       option is set to false, then the first/last vertex is contained.
 *   <li>In the SEMI_OPEN model, polylines contain all vertices except the last. Therefore if one
 *       polyline starts where another polyline stops, the two polylines do not intersect.
 *   <li>In the CLOSED model, polylines contain all of their vertices.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When multiple polylines are present, they are processed independently and have no effect on
 * each other. For example, in the OPEN boundary model the polyline ABC contains the vertex B, while
 * set of polylines {AB, BC} does not. (If you want to treat the polylines as a union instead, with
 * boundaries merged according to the "mod 2" rule, this can be achieved by reassembling the edges
 * into maximal polylines using S2PolylineVectorLayer with EdgeType.UNDIRECTED,
 * DuplicateEdges.MERGE, and PolylineType.WALK.)
 *
 * <p>Polygon boundaries are controlled by the PolygonModel class, which has the following options:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>In the OPEN model, polygons do not contain their vertices or edges. This implies that a
 *       polyline that follows the boundary of a polygon will not intersect it.
 *   <li>In the SEMI_OPEN model, polygon point containment is defined such that if several polygons
 *       tile the region around a vertex, then exactly one of those polygons contains that vertex.
 *       Similarly polygons contain all of their edges, but none of their reversed edges. This
 *       implies that a polyline and polygon edge with the same endpoints intersect if and only if
 *       they are in the same direction. (This rule ensures that if a polyline is intersected with a
 *       polygon and its complement, the two resulting polylines do not have any edges in common.)
 *   <li>In the CLOSED model, polygons contain all their vertices, edges, and reversed edges. This
 *       implies that a polyline that shares an edge (in either direction) with a polygon is defined
 *       to intersect it. Similarly, this is the only model where polygons that touch at a vertex or
 *       along an edge intersect.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that PolylineModel and PolygonModel are defined as separate classes in order to allow for
 * possible future extensions.
 *
 * <p>Operations between geometry of different dimensions are defined as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>For UNION, the higher-dimensional shape always wins. For example the union of a closed
 *       polygon A with a polyline B that coincides with the boundary of A consists only of the
 *       polygon A.
 *   <li>For INTERSECTION, the lower-dimensional shape always wins. For example, the intersection of
 *       a closed polygon A with a point B that coincides with a vertex of A consists only of the
 *       point B.
 *   <li>For DIFFERENCE, higher-dimensional shapes are not affected by subtracting lower-dimensional
 *       shapes. For example, subtracting a point or polyline from a polygon A yields the original
 *       polygon A. This rule exists because in general, it is impossible to represent the output
 *       using the specified boundary model(s). (Consider subtracting one vertex from a
 *       PolylineModel.CLOSED polyline, or subtracting one edge from a PolygonModel.CLOSED polygon.)
 *       If you want to perform operations like this, consider representing all boundaries
 *       explicitly (topological boundaries) using OPEN boundary models. Another option for polygons
 *       is to subtract a degenerate loop, which yields a polygon with a degenerate hole (see
 *       S2LaxPolygonShape).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that in the case of Precision.EXACT operations, the above remarks only apply to the
 * output before snapping. Snapping may cause nearby distinct edges to become coincident, e.g. a
 * polyline may become coincident with a polygon boundary. However also note that S2BooleanOperation
 * is perfectly happy to accept such geometry as input.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * S2ShapeIndex a, b;   // Input geometry, e.g. containing polygons.
 * S2BooleanOperation.Builder builder = new S2BooleanOperation.Builder();
 * builder.setSnapFunction(snapFunction);
 * S2PolygonLayer layer = new S2PolygonLayer();
 * S2BooleanOperation op = builder.build(OpType.INTERSECTION, layer, options);
 * S2Error error = new S2Error;
 * if (!op.build(a, b, error)) {
 *   logger.atError(error);
 *   return ...;
 * }
 * S2Polygon polygon = layer.getPolygon();   // Output geometry.
 * ...
 * }
 *
 * <p>If the output includes objects of different dimensions, they can be assembled into different
 * layers with code like this:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * S2BooleanOperation op = builder.build(
 *     OpType.UNION,
 *     new S2PointVectorLayer(),
 *     new S2PolylineVectorLayer(),
 *     new S2PolygonLayer());
 * }
 *
 * <p>Boolean operations are implemented by constructing the boundary of the result and then using
 * S2Builder to assemble the edges. The boundary is obtained by clipping each of the two input
 * regions to the interior or exterior of the other region. For example, to compute the union of A
 * and B, we clip the boundary of A to the exterior of B and the boundary of B to the exterior of A;
 * the resulting set of edges defines the union of the two regions.
 *
 * <p>We use exact predicates, but inexact constructions (e.g. computing the intersection point of
 * two edges). Nevertheless, the following algorithm is guaranteed to be 100% robust, in that the
 * computed boundary stays within a small tolerance (snapRadius + S2EdgeUtil.INTERSECTION_ERROR) of
 * the exact result, and also preserves the correct topology (i.e., no crossing edges).
 *
 * <p>Unfortunately this robustness cannot quite be achieved using the strategy outlined above
 * (clipping the two input regions and assembling the resulting edges). Since computed intersection
 * points are not exact, the input geometry passed to S2Builder might contain self-intersections,
 * and these self-intersections cannot be eliminated reliably by snap rounding.
 *
 * <p>So instead, we pass S2Builder the entire set of input edges where at least some portion of
 * each edge belongs to the output boundary. We allow S2Builder to compute the intersection points
 * and snap round the edges (which it does in a way that is guaranteed to preserve the input
 * topology). Then once this is finished, we remove the portions of each edge that would have been
 * clipped if we had done the clipping first. This step only involves deciding whether to keep or
 * discard each edge in the output, since all intersection points have already been resolved, and
 * therefore there is no risk of creating new self-intersections.
